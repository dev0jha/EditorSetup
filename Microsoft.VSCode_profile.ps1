# This file only exists to be used as a profile for the PowerShell terminal in VSCode. It is not used by the regular PowerShell terminal. This allows us to have different profiles for different terminals.

# . $PROFILE is the default profile for PowerShell, but we want to use a different profile for VSCode. So we will import the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file, which contains the aliases and functions we want to use in VSCode.
